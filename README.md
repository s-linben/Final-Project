# About
This is a final project on the story of a dying person, as you travel through his/her past. You uncover more and more, eventually recovering from your supposed amnesia. The main focus of the game is to create a seemingly human-like experience when dealing with death, similar to how Shakespeare did it (though less dramatic and no "poisonous unctions").

## Coding Information
This project uses the javafx visual library, though most implementation are incomplete. The game should hopefully be done within the next week, else I won't graduate and my Comp. Sci. grade will tank.

I will be also adding some useless stuff to test the code and make sure it works.

I like some of these documentations on how to use JavaFX. Note: Please don't sue me, I don't own any of the links that I'm posting.
