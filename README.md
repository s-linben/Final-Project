# About
This was a high school final project, though I don't like the code at all so I'm going to create another one.

## Coding Information
Most of the frameworks will surround JavaFX in order to learn more about one of Java's basic libraries. Most of the code requires you to know basic Java, as well as reading up on JavaFX on your own time. If you have any coding questions, email me.

## Reading Links
I like some of these documentations on how to use JavaFX. Note: Please don't sue me, I don't own any of the links that I'm posting.
